Barrel-Race-Android
===================

This game uses the accelerometer, a sensor found on most Android devices.  You can also use the gravimeter.  A barrel race is a rodeo event in which the rider starts at a gate and must ride completely around three (sometimes four) barrels. 
That is, he or she must circle each of the barrels.  The object is to get the fastest time without knocking over any of the barrels.
